The YT version is currently in build and its not working
Also this isn't my script, i modifiyed one that i find that was kinda working and solve the errors i got
This need a bit of RAM at least 16GB if what u are streaming its not super demanding, if it is maybe u get lag

1- For use it u shoul unzip all the files and use the install.bat
2- After this u have to run the main.py (u need to have python 3.11 dowloaded, un can do it from the microsoft store)
3- When the chorome tabs open try to click the accept cookies botton or u will have to enter your link manually one by one
4- U need to download chorome driver 133 to get the google.exe dev to make the script run (i wante dto uploaad it but its to heavy)

5- When u have de chorome driver u need to create a shorcut of the google.exe and put ir on the script folther, u will need to remove the one tahts already there.
6- Make shure the shorcut its called google.exe and not google-shorcut.exe or something like that
7- This should be enough to get it running
